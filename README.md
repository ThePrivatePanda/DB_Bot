A Bot to perform certain actions for a specific server: Dank Business (Previously Mason Co.): https://discord.gg/vT4XYySWzK

It is meant to be a better dynamically customizable bot rather than hardcoded configuration (so config.json finna be changin like craaaayz)
- That noted it still does have some hardcoded ids like the server id, which will, doesn't need to be configured, ever?

I have made this bot open source for a variety of reasons, which you may or may not currently know/understand or in the future.
